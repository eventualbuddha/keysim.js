# keysim.js

Simulate typing into DOM elements. This can be used anywhere you need to
simulate user keystrokes, but is particularly useful in testing environments.

## Installation

```sh
# Install via npm.
$ npm install [--save-dev] keysim
# Install via yarn.
$ yarn add [--dev] keysim
# Install by copying the dist file.
$ curl -o path/to/vendor/keysim.js https://unpkg.com/keysim@latest/dist/keysim.js
```

## Usage

There are two high-level methods for simulating keystrokes on a DOM element, one
for typing input into an element and one for typing non-input "action"
keystrokes. **Note that none of the methods provided by keysim will trigger the
browser's default behavior, such as inserting text or moving the cursor. It only
allows you to test your event handling code by sending the correct DOM events.**

### Entering Text

Get a standard keyboard and use it to fire events onto a DOM element:

```js
let input = document.getElementById("name");
let keyboard = Keysim.Keyboard.US_ENGLISH;
keyboard.dispatchEventsForInput("hello!", input);
```

This will fire events `keydown`, `keypress`, `keyup`, and `textInput` events
for each typed character in the input string. In addition, some characters
may require modifier keys in order to type. The `keydown` and `keyup` events
will be fired for these modifier keys (e.g. the SHIFT key) as appropriate.

### Triggering Special Actions

It is also sometimes useful to simulate special keys, or actions that do not
cause input. For example, here's how to simulate backward deleting a word and
selecting all text in the input:

```js
let input = document.getElementById("name");
let keyboard = Keysim.Keyboard.US_ENGLISH;
keyboard.dispatchEventsForAction("alt+backspace", input);
keyboard.dispatchEventsForAction(`${osx ? "meta" : "ctrl"}+a`, input);
```

### Raw Keystroke Dispatch

If you need to dispatch events for an exact sequence of keystrokes you may use
`Keyboard#dispatchEventsForKeystroke`, which is used by both
`Keyboard#dispatchEventsForInput` and `Keyboard#dispatchEventsForAction`.

```js
let input = document.getElementById("name");
let keyboard = Keysim.Keyboard.US_ENGLISH;
let ctrl_shift_enter = new Keysim.Keystroke(
  Keysim.Keystroke.CTRL | Keysim.Keystroke.SHIFT,
  13
);
keyboard.dispatchEventsForKeystroke(ctrl_shift_enter, input);
```

## Building

Ensure that the keysim dependencies are installed (`npm install`). Then run
`npm run build` to re-create `dist/keysim.js`.

## Testing

To run the tests in Chrome, run `npm run test:browser`. To run the tests in node,
run `npm run test:node`. Running `npm test` will run both.

## Contributing

Fork the project, create a branch, and fix your bug or add your feature on that
branch. Be sure to add tests for your bug fix or feature.
